In this project I am trying to generate some lines from the 5 Short Stories of Rabindranath Tagore, named ``` Monihara , Byabodhan, Protibeshini, Progotishonghar, Malyodhan``` , in Bangla. It is a very simple project of Natural Language Processing, which requires Recurrent Neural Network. It will learn the stories from the text files. Then It will generate 20 lines from a random sentence from the Story. Many complex things can be done, I am willing to work on it more in the future God willing . This project is inspired by [this blog](https://machinelearningmastery.com/text-generation-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/). The prediction looks like the given image.
